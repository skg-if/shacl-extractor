# SKG-IF JSON-LD Context

This repository contains the JSON-LD context for SKG-IF. The directories contain relevant information about the JSON-LD context, in particular:

* the folder `scripts` contains programming scripts for performing several activities on the SKG-IF JSON-LD compliant data (e.g., the script for converting a JSON-LD file into RDF/Turtle);

* the folder `ver` contains all the versions of the JSON-LD context developed (and related samples within), to track the evolution of the context in time.
