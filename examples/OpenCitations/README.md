These examples are extracted from a few requests from the [OpenCitations Meta API](https://w3id.org/oc/meta/api/v1) and have been converted in SKG-IF JSON-LD and, just to provide an overall view, also in Turtle format to see the RDF in a more human-readable way. In particular:

* `oc_1.json` is the source returned by the OpenCitations Meta API (in JSON), containing two distincts research products, i.e. a journal article and a book chapter;

* `oc_1.jsonld` is the result of the conversion of the source in SKG-IF JSON-LD format;

* `oc_1.ttl` is the rendering of the SKG-IF document in another RDF format (Turtle).
